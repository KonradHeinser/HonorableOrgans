When you are attacked, you have 4 choices. Give up, kill them all, turn them into prisoners, or turn them into organs. Normally, the Tribute Collector only accepts the results of the third one, but this mod makes it so they'll accept the fourth option as well. This only applies for natural organs because they only need organs for the body purists.
